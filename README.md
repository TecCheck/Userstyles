# Userstyles
These are my modular userstyles. This repo contains two types of styles: `base` and `sites`. Base styles provide a color theme for the site specific styles to apply. You can use any of the base styles with any of the site styles. 

If you want to make your own base style, it has to export the following colors:
| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| color_text | The normal text color |
| color_background | Background color |
| color_background_dark | Darker variant of the background color |
| color_accent | Accent color |
| color_red | Red |
| color_green | Green |
| color_yellow | Yellow |
| color_blue | Blue |
| color_magenta | Magenta - a kind of pink |
| color_cyan | Cyan - it's a bit like light blue |
